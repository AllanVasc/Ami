Ami is a TJ Bot robot that, with the implemetation of some IBM's API, develop conversations with a child.
Then, with a tenuous vocabulary, it creates a _bond_ with the child.
####
Our iOS application retrieves data from the conversations, which are stored in a database, and shows the analysis of the perceived emotions and key-words the child said.

## Notes:
Made in **Swift 5** for  target iOS version **10.3** or greater
####
We are using CocoaPods to gather the [Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) module
